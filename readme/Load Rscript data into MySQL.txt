Source: https://github.com/ffirke/baseball_etl/tree/master/mysql

Tools:
	R, RMySQL, MySQL
	
Installing RMySQL on Mac

1. Download MySQL from dev.mysql.com. Make sure to get the 64-bit version.

2. Uncompress mysql-xxx.tar.gz somewhere which we’ll now refer to as MYSQL_HOME. 
It should contain directories such as bin, lib, and include.
To set the path MYSQL_HOME in the command line:
		SET MYSQL_HOME=path of MySQL
3. Download R from CRAN.

4. Download RMySQL package source from CRAN. We’ll refer to the path of that 
RMySQL_xxx.tar.gz as RMYSQL_PATH.

5. Before installing RMySQL, we need to place libmysqlclient.18.dylib in a place where 
RMySQL can find it. sudo ln -s MYSQL_HOME/lib/libmysqlclient.18.dylib /usr/lib/libmysqlclient.18.dylib.
Or we can use other version available in our MYSQL_HOME directory. 

6. In terminal, use the following command to install RMySQL. 
R CMD INSTALL –configure-args=’–with-mysql-dir=MYSQL_HOME –with-mysql-inc=MYSQL_HOME/include –with-mysql-lib=MYSQL_HOME/lib’ RMYSQL_PATH
This is documented as one of the options in the installation guide.
Note: Change the directory of RMysql 

7. library(RMySQL) should know work in the R interactive shell.

8. Log in to your MySQL client
	mysql -u root -p 
	then enter password
9. Inside mysql, set the local-infile to true:
	SET GLOBAL local-infile=true;
	You can check it by: SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'local_infile';
	
10. Then we run Rscript file from command line (in the same directory where you have the script file)
	Rscript gamelogs.R
